## Three Budget Eras

**Phase 1: Fiscal Austerity (FY2015–FY2020)**
- Target: 2-3% annual increases
- Method: Deferred maintenance, nominal stipends for elected roles
- Trade-off: Infrastructure and personnel gaps accumulated

**Phase 2: Correction (FY2021–FY2022)**
- 11.45% increase in FY2021—largest in a decade
- Acknowledged: Severe weather required capital road reconstruction, not patching
- Wages adjusted: Fire stipends increased 500%, part-time floor set at $20/hr

**Phase 3: Crisis & Inflation (FY2023–FY2026)**
- July 2023 and July 2024 floods caused millions in road damage
- Town paying $60k+ interest on credit lines while awaiting FEMA reimbursement
- State mandates added: town-wide reappraisal, website accessibility, IT modernization

## Primary Cost Drivers

**1. Personnel Professionalization**
- Elected Listers → contracted professional assessors
- New roles added: Recreation Director (FY18), Grants Manager (FY22)
- Highway wages rose 17.3% in FY23 to retain plow drivers

**2. Road Resilience**
- Shifted from routine grading to climate-resilient infrastructure
- Mud season mitigation: $37,500 line item created in FY24
- Materials inflation: gravel and parts up 50-135% in single years

**3. Health Insurance**
- Premiums rose 23% (FY26) and 27.9% (FY23)
- Often consumes most of the allowable annual budget increase

**4. Capital Planning**
- $50,000 annual set-aside for future equipment purchases
- Replaces old method of emergency loans when vehicles failed
- Example: Fire Station bond ($780,000 principal, 2009 issuance, refinanced 2014)
  - 27-year term with semi-annual payments through 2038
  - Coupon rates: 1.91%–5.42%
  - Annual debt service: ~$70,000–$80,000 in early years, declining to ~$40,000 by 2025
  - As % of budget: ~6.5% in 2016 ($71k / $1.1M) → ~2% today ($40k / $1.8M)
  - Interest alone averaged ~2% of total town budget annually
- **Looking ahead:** The town faces 4–5x this amount in capital needs over the next 5 years (town garage, town hall, road crew vehicle replacements—estimated $3–4M total). The choice: invest in a capital fund now, or require future residents to pay 20%+ in interest on those purchases a decade from now.

## What the Data Shows

**2017–2020:** Budget tracked inflation closely (1-2% range)

**2021 (Breakpoint):** Budget jumped 11.45% while inflation was only 1.2%—correcting years of deferred spending

**2023–Present:** Budget increases of 9-11% despite inflation falling to 2-3%—driven by flood debt, state mandates, and new capital reserves, not general price increases

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Total growth (FY2012→FY2024):** $1.07M → $1.66M (+55%, ~3.6%/year)
- **Biggest driver:** Public Works (+91%)—wages, benefits, equipment debt, and materials
- **Biggest shock:** 2023 floods caused $2.6M in unbudgeted emergency spending
- **Structural shift:** Town moved from reactive spending to planned Capital Improvement reserves
