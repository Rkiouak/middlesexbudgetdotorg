### Why CPI Doesn't Tell the Whole Story

The Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) measures general household goods—groceries, gas, rent. But a municipal budget is dominated by **wages, benefits, and construction materials**, which have their own inflation rates:

| Year | CPI-U (General Goods) | ECI (Gov. Wages & Benefits) | Highway Costs (NHCCI) | Materials (Roads/Infra) |
|------|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 2025 | ~2.7% | 3.5% | ~4% (est) | 2.6% |
| 2024 | 3.4% | 4.8% | 12.2% | 3.2% |
| 2023 | 3.3% | 4.6% | 25.2% | 5.6% |
| 2022 | 7.1% | 3.8% | 20.0% | 15.8% |
| 2021 | 4.0% | 2.6% | -3.0% | 13.4% |
| 2020 | 1.3% | 2.7% | 6.5% | 2.5% |
| 2019 | 1.6% | 2.9% | 10.8% | 1.5% |
| 2018 | 2.3% | 2.7% | 3.1% | 3.0% |
| 2017 | 1.9% | 2.4% | -0.6% | 2.8% |
| 2016 | 1.3% | 2.4% | -5.2% | 1.3% |
| 2015 | -0.2% | 2.3% | 5.5% | -1.5% |
| 2014 | 1.3% | 2.1% | 2.5% | 1.3% |
| 2013 | 1.5% | 1.8% | -2.5% | 1.8% |
| 2012 | 1.8% | 1.6% | 11.6% | 1.5% |
| 2011 | 3.2% | 1.6% | 1.4% | 5.2% |

*Sources: BLS CPI-U Northeast, BLS Employment Cost Index (State/Local), FHWA National Highway Construction Cost Index (NHCCI), BLS PPI for Construction Materials.*

**Key insight:** When highway construction costs spiked 20% (2022) and road materials rose 15.8%, CPI was only 7.1%. In 2023, highway costs rose another 25% while CPI was just 3.3%. The town's costs—predominantly highway labor, health insurance, and gravel—track closer to NHCCI and PPI than to the consumer inflation rate. Comparing the town budget to CPI understates the real inflationary pressure on municipal operations.

## Resident Income Growth

Middlesex residents have consistently higher incomes than the broader Washington County population—and that gap has widened over time. From 2019 to 2023, the typical Middlesex household saw income grow from $83K to $112K, a 35% increase. During the same period, Washington County median household income grew from $66K to $80K (21%).

The pandemic years (2020–2022) were particularly notable: Middlesex incomes surged 16% in a single year, likely reflecting an influx of remote workers who chose the town for its rural character and proximity to Montpelier. This wealth premium matters for budget discussions—it means Middlesex has a stronger tax base per household than neighboring communities, but also higher expectations for services and infrastructure.

### Key Takeaways

**Middlesex Wealth Premium:** In 2023, the typical Middlesex household earned ~$32,000 more than the typical Washington County household ($112K vs $80K).

**Faster Growth:** Middlesex incomes jumped significantly in 2020 (+16.1%) compared to the county's more modest increase (+6.3%), suggesting Middlesex attracted higher-earning remote workers during the pandemic shift.

**Per Capita Strength:** Middlesex residents earn about 37% more per person ($61,818) than the county average ($45,017), indicating a strong tax base relative to the region.

## Three Budget Eras

**Phase 1: Fiscal Austerity (FY2015–FY2020)**
- Target: 2-3% annual increases
- Method: Deferred maintenance, nominal stipends for elected roles
- Trade-off: Infrastructure and personnel gaps accumulated

**Phase 2: Correction (FY2021–FY2022)**
- 11.45% increase in FY2021—largest in a decade
- Acknowledged: Severe weather required capital road reconstruction, not patching
- Wages adjusted: Fire stipends increased 500%, part-time floor set at $20/hr

**Phase 3: Crisis & Inflation (FY2023–FY2027)**
- July 2023 and July 2024 floods caused $5.3M+ in road damage
- Town paying $60k+ interest on credit lines while awaiting FEMA reimbursement
- State mandates added: town-wide reappraisal, website accessibility, IT modernization
- FY2027: Town Administrator position proposed to provide town project oversight, flood recovery support, Select Board assistance, and grant management

---

## Primary Cost Drivers

**1. Personnel Professionalization**
- Elected Listers → contracted professional assessors
- New roles added: Recreation Director (FY18), Grants Manager (FY22)
- Highway wages rose 17.3% in FY23 to retain plow drivers

**2. Road Resilience**
- Shifted from routine grading to climate-resilient infrastructure
- Mud season mitigation: $37,500 line item created in FY24
- Materials inflation: gravel and parts up 50-135% in single years

**3. Health Insurance**
- Premiums rose 23% (FY26) and 27.9% (FY23)
- Often consumes most of the allowable annual budget increase

**4. Capital Planning**
- $50,000 annual set-aside for future equipment purchases
- Replaces old method of emergency loans when vehicles failed
- Example: Fire Station bond ($780,000 principal, 2009 issuance, refinanced 2014)
  - 27-year term with semi-annual payments through 2038
  - Coupon rates: 1.91%–5.42%
  - Annual debt service: ~$70,000–$80,000 in early years, declining to ~$40,000 by 2025
  - As % of budget: ~6.5% in 2016 ($71k / $1.1M) → ~2% today ($40k / $1.8M)
  - Interest alone averaged ~2% of total town budget annually
- **Looking ahead:** The town faces 4–5x this amount in capital needs over the next 5 years (town garage, town hall, road crew vehicle replacements—estimated $3–4M total). The choice: invest in a capital fund now, or require future residents to pay 20%+ in interest on those purchases a decade from now.

## What the Data Shows

**2017–2020:** Budget tracked inflation closely (1-2% range)

**2021 (Breakpoint):** Budget jumped 11.45% while inflation was only 1.2%—correcting years of deferred spending

**2023–2026:** Budget increases of 9-11% despite inflation falling to 2-3%—driven by flood debt, state mandates, and new capital reserves

**2027 (Proposed):** 13.16% increase reflects new Town Administrator position, health insurance upgrade to MVP Gold plan, and sand/trucking costs returning to normal after years of savings from the town's sand pit

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Total growth (FY2012→FY2027 proposed):** $1.07M → $2.17M (+103%, ~5.0%/year)
- **FY2027 drivers:** Town Administrator position ($91K net), health insurance plan upgrade, sand/trucking return to normal after years of sand pit savings
- **Biggest shock:** 2023-2024 floods caused $5.3M+ in unbudgeted emergency spending; FEMA reimbursement still pending
- **Structural shift:** Town moved from reactive spending to planned Capital Improvement reserves
